Notes on JSON and the Fetch API

//Fetch: an API (Application Programming Interface)

Fetch: used to make HTTP requests from your backend to your frontend for data, or make requests from your frontend (like we will in this project) to your backend for data.

You can also use Fetch to access third party API's (like the one used in this project) to return data to your application from an external source

*Fetch is built into the browser!

"get request" loading a webpage, getting data from a server

"post request" posting data to a server (filling out a form, etc. )

"put/patch request" updating data on a server 

"delete request" deleting data from a server

//Check Fetch and JSON crash course on YouTube

//items.JSON 

Before we make a request from an API, we can quickly make a request from a file as well

//JSON

JSON: 

Very similar to an Object in JavaScript

We have key value pairs inside of curly braces 

ex. 

{
   "key": "String Value1", 
   "key2": 4, 
   "etc": ...  
}

or arrays 

ex. 

[
    {"id": 1, "text": "Item One"}, 
    {"id": 2, "text": "Item Two"}, 
    {"id": 3, "text": "Item Three"}
]

//see file

Note: understanding "status: " from a JSON response is very important
